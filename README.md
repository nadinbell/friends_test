# friends_test
This is a very simple basic React app, using TypeScript and Redux

There are still many things to do: 
 - error handling (add and fix);
 - fix checking styling;
 - fix checking types;
 - cover with tests;
 - add more complex and interesting logic etc.

To run the project:

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
